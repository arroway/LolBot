App::LolBot version 0.01
=======================

This module provides some features to run an IRC bot. 
At the moment, it does not much more than connecting itself on a IRC chan, memorizing who's there or who joins 
and (killer feature) counting how many "lol" are said on the chan (by each user).

Features to come: more elaborate stats and a web interface
